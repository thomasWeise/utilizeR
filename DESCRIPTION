Description: Here we store some utilities shared by our other packages. One
    important export is the function \code{\link{ignoreErrors}(exp)} which
    executes the expression and ignores all errors or warnings. This is
    useful when dealing with expressions that maybe assign some result
    (like \code{\link{ignoreErrors}(result <- dodgyFunction())}) but may
    fail for reasons which can safely be ignored. Another useful utility is
    the \code{\link{path.batchApply}} which follows a visitor design
    pattern to (recursively) feed a supplied function with all files in a
    directory that fit to an (also supplied) regular expression. The result
    is returned as a list, much like the \code{\link{lapply}}, if wanted.
    \code{\link{path.batchApply}} can also automatically parallelize the
    computation by using \code{\link[parallel]{mclapply}} from the
    \code{parallel} package internally. This allows for a more convenient
    and automatic batch processing of data in folders.
    \code{\link{path.batchProcessor}} can create a wrapper for an input/
    output- file-style processor to adapt it to the
    \code{\link{path.batchApply}} interface. The other functions like
    \code{\link{path.commonPrefix}}, \code{\link{path.extensionRegExp}},
    and \code{\link{path.relativize}} also are building blocks that are
    used by and fit to the \code{\link{path.batchApply}} code. This library
    also includes some shared classes, such as \code{\link{functionOrNULL}}
    and \code{\link{numericOrNULL}}, which we use in some of our other
    classes to allow for members which can either be \code{NULL} or, well,
    a function or numeric vector.
